# Article-Summerization-ML
An Extractive based Article summarization implemented using Machine Learning, which takes url or plain-text as input and returns article summary. 
An android application and a web application(http://get-article-summary.herokuapp.com/) were developed for the front end.

We found an algorithm(https://blog.floydhub.com/gentle-introduction-to-text-summarization-in-machine-learning/) that helped us understand how to implement text summarization. 
We studied it and introduced some new elements, tweaking it to suit our needs better.
